## General Information

"In this project, weâ€™ll build a style guide/design system for our website. Developers and designers use design systems in order to organize the look and feel of a website or web application. Design systems help to document the visual vocabulary and reusable components of a large website.

As your websites grow larger and more complex, having a consistent set of styles will help them stay cohesive and enjoyable for users! It also helps as you start working with other developers, as you can have a consistent reference for how your website should be built." - Codecademy
